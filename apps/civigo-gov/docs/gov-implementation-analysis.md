### What’s implemented

- Auth and guards (SSR, @supabase/ssr)
  - Central SSR client via cookie-based session; no service-role in browser.
  - Admin and Officer route groups guarded in Server Components; wrong-role redirects handled symmetrically.
  - Shared sign-in routes by role (admin → /admin, officer → /officer); client redirect for UX, SSR guards as source of truth.

- Admin module
  - Departments: CRUD with shadcn UI, SSR Server Actions, pagination helpers.
  - Officers: create profile (admin flow), reset password, list, assign to departments, toggle assignment active.

- Officer module
  - Landing at /officer lists active departments; auto-redirect when only one.
  - Per-department page /officer/departments/[deptId] guarded by active assignment; shows header and scoped appointments list.

- Services (officer, department-scoped)
  - SSR list at /officer/departments/[deptId]/services with pagination and search using OR ilike across code/name.
  - Server Actions: create/update/delete with Zod validation and typed results; revalidatePath on success.
  - Client dialogs (create/edit/delete) with shadcn Dialog/Form, react-hook-form + Zod, sonner toasts, disabled states.

- Tests and docs
  - Guards/utilities tests present; officer landing/guard tests added; services action/guard tests added; UI test pending.
  - README updated with officer dashboard and department chooser; services notes present; tasks board maintained.

- Best-practice alignment
  - RLS-first design in schema; SSR-only mutations via Server Actions; no service-role client-side.
  - shadcn/ui + sonner used consistently; revalidatePath on actions to refresh data.

### CRUD coverage by entity

- Departments
  - Create: implemented (admin)
  - Read: implemented (admin, officer where needed)
  - Update: implemented (admin)
  - Delete: implemented (admin)

- Services (scoped to department)
  - Create: implemented (officer with active assignment)
  - Read: implemented (officer, SSR list with search/pagination)
  - Update: implemented (officer with active assignment)
  - Delete: implemented (officer with active assignment)

- Officers (auth user + profiles)
  - Create: implemented (admin creates/links profile; can create auth user if missing)
  - Read: implemented (admin list)
  - Update: partial (reset password supported; editing profile fields like full_name/phone not yet surfaced)
  - Delete: intentionally omitted (typical ops disable account or revoke assignments rather than delete)

- Officer assignments
  - Create: implemented (assign to department)
  - Read: implemented (lists/joins)
  - Update: implemented (toggle active)
  - Delete: not explicit (active toggle covers most needs; optional hard delete not exposed)

### Gaps and recommendations

- Services RLS
  - Current migrations keep RLS disabled on public.services (departments/services readable by all). For DB-level enforcement (beyond app guards), enable RLS on services and add policies to allow officers with an active assignment to CRUD rows where services.department_id matches an assigned department; keep admin full-access policy.
  - Benefit: action tests can assert insufficient_privilege; defense-in-depth if app guards are bypassed.

- Officer UX enhancements (optional)
  - Expose edit for officer profile fields (full_name, phone) in admin; audit logging if needed.
  - Offer explicit unassign (delete officer_assignments row) alongside active toggle.

- Officer appointment lifecycle (next functional slice)
  - Add check-in, start, complete, cancel, no-show Server Actions with SSR guard; revalidatePath per Next.js Server Actions guidance.

- Services UI niceties
  - Toolbar search input and pagination controls on services list page; basic UI test coverage.

### Go/No-Go to Citizen App

- Recommendation: Gov-first (short) then Citizen
  - Rationale: Services RLS is the only critical backend gap; enabling it is a small migration that materially improves security and test fidelity. Toolbar search/pager controls and a basic UI test close the loop on the new services feature. These items are small and reduce rework later.
  - Gov-first short list:
    - Enable RLS on public.services and add officer/admin policies matching department scope.
    - Add toolbar search input and pagination controls UI on services page; add UI test.
    - (Optional) Expose officer profile edit and explicit unassign.

- After that: Go to Citizen App
  - Implement citizen booking flows (browse services, book appointment, view/manage bookings) with SSR + RLS.
  - Ensure appointment capacity logic, T‑24h window selector, and notifications are covered per standards.

References
- Supabase RLS: enable RLS per table; write policies based on request.jwt.claims role and joins (officer_assignments) to scope access.
- Next.js Server Actions: keep mutations async; use revalidatePath with literal paths for dynamic routes or the "page" form.
- shadcn/ui + sonner: keep Toaster mounted once; trigger success/error toasts in client islands; validate with zod and show inline errors.
