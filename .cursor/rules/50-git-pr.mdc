Branch per task; no direct commits to main; open PR with template covering Problem, Approach, Risks, Tests, Migrations, Env changes.

Enforce Conventional Commits; include scope where useful (feat(citizen-booking): â€¦); use BREAKING CHANGE footer or ! if needed.

Summarize edits in PR and rationale; avoid cross-app refactors without an approved plan.
