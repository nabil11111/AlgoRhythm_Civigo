Email sending happens server-side only via Server Actions or Route Handlers; RESEND_API_KEY must not be exposed to the browser.

Provide both HTML and text alternatives; keep templates simple and testable.

Idempotency for reminders: check notification_log before sending; record sends with correlation ids for auditing.
