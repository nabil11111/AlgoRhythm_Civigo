alwaysApply: true

Never commit secrets or credentials; read all config from environment variables (.env). Do not paste API keys (Supabase anon/service, Resend) into code or comments.

TypeScript strict: avoid any; prefer precise types and narrow unions.

Validate all inputs to Server Actions/Route Handlers with zod (or equivalent) before DB/network calls.

Tests required when changing logic on critical flows (booking, slot capacity, status transitions, reminder selection).

Use Conventional Commits for all commits: feat, fix, chore, docs, refactor, test, perf, build, ci; use feat(scope): description; mark breaking changes with ! or BREAKING CHANGE footer.

Small, focused changes: if >5 files must change, propose a plan first, then implement in steps.

Do not add dependencies without justification and alternatives noted in the PR description.
